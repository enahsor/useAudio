# useAudio  

## What is it ?

This is a hook implementation wrapped around a `Audio` instantiation.

## How to use ?

```
const instance = useAudio(src)
```
It functions similar to how the `Audio` constructor would function.
You'll see that almost all the same methods and properties are exposed as well.
